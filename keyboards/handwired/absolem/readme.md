# Absolem

The absolem is basically a non-split Minidox with a few additional ergonomy tweaks. The keymap template is shamelessly stolen from one of the neighboring folders (Atreus, iirc) and then modified to Colemak Mod-DH with oneshot symbols and accents + mod-tap navigation and number layers.

Its predecessor is the "Polygon" from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/9aam0u/polygon_a_prototype_demo_a_roadmap_and_lots_of/), the current version forgoes the separate thumb plane and the split nature for increased "minimalism" and portability (plus I've always used it in this position anyway). The next tieration will hopefully combine this layout (or something very similar) with a wireless uC. Once the design is finalized, I also plan to forego my trusty cardboard for something more durable...
